# NeatoFollowingNeato

## Run

## Overview
Quite true to its name, this project is about Neatos following Neatos that can create a line of slithering Neatos, with the only limiting factor being the number of available Neatos to connect to. This project was inspired from an in-class lab, "Neato Soccer" (link here). 

## Approach

## Design Decisions
proportional speed (팍팍 멈췄다)  vs. hard-coded speed (나름 smooth

## Conclusion

### Challenges
- lidar camera cannot recognize neato in front of it unless the neato had something high on it
- neato could not identify the front neato when there was a difference in lighting

### Improvements
- syncing up the speed of the different robots (e.g. using the odometry of each robot)

### Lessons
